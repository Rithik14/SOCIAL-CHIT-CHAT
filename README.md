   Today Developers around the world are making efforts to enhance user experience of using application a well as to enhance the developer’s workflow of designing applications to deliver projects and rollout change  requests under strict timeline. Stacks can be used to build web applications in the shortest span of time. The  stacks used in web development are basically the response of software engineers to current demands. They  have essentially adopted pre-existing frameworks (including JavaScript) to make their lives easier. 
   
 While there are many, MEAN and MERN are just two of the popular stacks that have evolved out of  JavaScript. Both stacks are made up of open source components and offer an end-to-end framework for building comprehensive web apps that enable browsers to connect with databases. Another advantage of building web projects with MERN is the fact that one can benefit from its enhanced flexibility. In order to understand MERN stack, we need to understand the four components that make up the MERN stack namely – MongoDB, Express.js, React and Node.js
