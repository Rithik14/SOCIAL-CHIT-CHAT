# SOCIAL-CHIT-CHAT
<p>The aim of the project is to build chat website with a lot of features like online indicator, 
uploads/attachments, auto-scrolling and many others. Chatting is a method of using technology to bring 
people and ideas together despite of the geographical barriers. The technology has been available for 
years but the acceptance was quite recent.</p>

 <p>Our project is made up of two applications - the client application, which runs on the userâ€™s 
web browser and server application, runs on any hosting servers on the network. To start chatting client 
should get connected to server where they can do private and group chat. Security measures were taken 
during the last one. Any user can connect to it from an open window/tab, is able to upload an image to 
use as avatar during the chat, each connected user will see instantly any message sent. The application 
overcomes the disadvantage of going to each and every application and then doing the task. It provides 
a single chat room that can be used for doing a variety of tasks.
</p>
<p>All the tasks are automated to enhance the user experience. The application full stack chat app 
is developed by using MERN (mongo, express, react, node). It is used to build web application and 
has been used to develop real time chat application.</p>
